            <b>FAYA:80 </b>aims to be a free, open and cooperative event. This means we expect collaboration from all the FAYA:80 participants, and for everybody to behave respectfully towards all others, including those that are different or think differently

            Please be helpful, considerate, friendly and respectful towards all other participants and respect the environment. We don't condone harassment or offensive behaviour at our conference. We consider it against our values as human beings. We're voicing
